# Unit Test Concept (Batch)

The web application of this project defines the test method unique to the project.

（[Unit Test Concept (Web)](Unit_test_concept_(Web).md)）

In principle, batches observe the [Nablarch standard test method](https://nablarch.github.io/docs/LATEST/doc/en/development_tools/testing_framework/guide/development_guide/05_UnitTestGuide/index.html).

Describes the deliverables created by the developer and how to test them.
