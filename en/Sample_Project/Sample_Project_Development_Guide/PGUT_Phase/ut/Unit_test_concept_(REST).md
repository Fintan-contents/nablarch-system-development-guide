# Unit Test Concept (REST)

This project's web application has defined its own test method for the project.
（[Unit Test Concept (Web)](./Unit_test_concept_(Web).md)）

In principle, REST follows [Nablarch standard testing method](https://nablarch.github.io/docs/LATEST/doc/en/development_tools/testing_framework/index.html).

Describes the deliverables to be created by the developer and how they will be tested.

| Form          | X           | X          | X       |
| Domain class  | X           |            | X       |
