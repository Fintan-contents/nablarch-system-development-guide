# Jakarta Server Pages Style Guide

Here you will find coding conventions to help you code in Jakarta Server Pages.
This coding convention is based on [Jakarta Server Pages custom tags for the Nablarch Application Framework](https://nablarch.github.io/docs/LATEST/doc/en/application_framework/application_framework/libraries/tag.html). However, each convention includes a reason as to why the convention must be followed. The concept of the conventions is not dependent on Nablarch, so if you use other frameworks, please refer to the concept of each convention to create a coding convention that matches the framework you use.
