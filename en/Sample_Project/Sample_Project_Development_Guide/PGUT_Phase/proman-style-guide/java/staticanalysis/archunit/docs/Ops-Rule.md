# ArchUnit Apply Guide

This is a guide for applying ArchUnit in an actual project.

The term "architecture violation" is used this section to mean "violates the architecture rule being tested using ArchUnit".

## Basic Principles

### Principle 1: Resolve all architecture violations

Code that violates the architecture defined in the project is a breeding ground for bugs, and can lead to an unintentional increase in the scope of influence during modifications.  
If the architecture is violated, automated tests will fail. If a test failure is left unattended, not only the architecture violation will be missed, but also the logic problem will be missed and the quality of the source code will not be maintained. Please make sure that all tests succeed.

### Principle 2: Don't reduce the quality of code to eliminate architecture violations

Developers should take action when they find architectural violations, but they should not compromise the quality of the source code by fixing it to avoid the violation.

If Developers are not sure how to deal with it, please consult with experts or project architects for appropriate measures.

### Principle 3: If there is a valid reason for an architectural violation, exclude it from the check

If there is a valid reason, will exclude source code that is an architecture violation from the check.

If the project's architect receives an application from a developer and determines that it is reasonable
Exclude the relevant sections from the checklist.

This operation will prevent violations from being left unattended and developers from being forced to avoid them.

## Notes on Test Execution

### About the classes being tested

ArchUnit allows you to filter the classes included in the classpath/module path by package.

Obviously, classes that are not part of the classpath/module path cannot be tested.

This is the case if have separate modules for each processing method, such as batch and web apps.

If want to test for either module, consider creating a module for ArchUnit testing that relies on both of these.

### About the time it takes to execute the test

Due to the increase in the number of target classes and other factors, the test execution may take a lot of time.

If this is not an unacceptable amount of time, you should consider creating a module for ArchUnit's testing or exclude it from the test runtime.

## Exception registration rule

### How to Exclude Architecture Violations

There are two main methods to exclude architecture violations from testing.

- Describe the exclusion target in the test code.
- Describe in the exclusion configuration file and exclude it from all architecture tests.

Note that the former is described differently depending on the subject of the test.

### Configuration of the exclusion target class (the exclusion target is described in the test code)

If the test target is a class (including layers), then the argument to `and()` (or `that()` if there is no `that()` to begin with) is `DescribedPredicate.not(JavaClass.Predicates.belongToAnyOf(Excluded Exclude classes 1, 2, and so on...)]` to set up the exclusion.

``` java
@ArchTest
public static final ArchRule actionClassMustInheritFromBatchAction. =
        ArchRuleDefinition.classes().that().haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Action")
        .and(DescribedPredicate.not(
                JavaClass.Predicates.belongToAnyOf(
                  PromanExampleAction.class, // #12345
                  PromanServiceAction.class  // #12346
                )
        )).should().beAssignableTo(BatchAction.class);
```

If the test target is contained in a class, such as a field or a method, the `areNotDeclaredIn()` is used to set the exclusion.

``` java
@ArchTest
public static final ArchRule methodsThatTakeDaoContextAsAnArgumentMustBePackagePrivate =
        ArchRuleDefinition.methods().that().haveRawParameterTypes(DaoContext.class)
            .and().areNotDeclaredIn(PromanExamAction.class)  // #1234
            .should().bePackagePrivate();
```

If make an exclusion setting, can follow the history later by doing the following.

- Describe the issue management system's issue management number in the comments of the source code.
- Include in the commit comments in the version control system.

### Configuring the exclusion package (specifying the exclusion target in the test code)

If test targets are classes, can exclude certain packages in the following way.
In the following example, exclude packages containing `common`.

```java
@ArchTest
public  static  final ArchRule noClassesUsingNoDataExceptionInNonInstrumentalPackages =
        ArchRuleDefinition.noClasses()
        .that().resideOutsideOfPackage("..common..") // #1234
        .should().dependOnClassesThat().areAssignableTo(NoDataException.class);
```

However, you should consider the package structure beforehand, as packages are subject to specific strings.

### Exclusions by custom rules (to list the exclusions in the test code)

Custom rules can be implemented to allow for more granular exclusions.
Refer to the [ArchUnit User Guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_creating_custom_rules) for more information.

### Exclude it from all architecture tests by including it in the exclusion configuration file

Create the `archunit_ignore_patterns.txt` under `src/test/resources` of the module for architecture testing, and write regular expressions to exclude them.
Can ignore violations of class `some.pkg.LegacyService` by writing the following.

```
# 1234
.*some\.pkg\.LegacyService.*
```

Can include comments by adding a `#` so that you can track the history later if you do the following.

- Describe the issue management system's issue management number in the comments of the configuration file.
- Include in the commit comments in the version control system.

#### Note

Exclusions made in this way will be excluded from all architecture tests.
To minimize the number of tests to be excluded, try to exclude them as much as possible using the aforementioned "Describe the exclusion target in the test code" method.
