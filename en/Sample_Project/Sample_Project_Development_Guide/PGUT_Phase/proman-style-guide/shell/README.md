# Shell Script Style Guide

Here development standards to help you code in shell script are provided.
This development standard is based on the assumption that [the shell script automatic generation tool](https://github.com/nablarch-development-standards/nablarch-development-standards-tools/tree/master/en/Batch-Development-Assistance) provided by [Nablarch](https://fintan.jp/en/page/1954/) is used. If you do not use the shell script automatic generation tool, please create a development standard that matches the framework. The "2.1.5. Coding Rules" in this development standard is independent of Nablarch and can be used for other frameworks as the rules are universally applicable.
