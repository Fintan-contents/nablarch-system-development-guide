# Setting Up the Team Development Environment
A variety of tools are required to get started with team development.

| Item                     | Example                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Source code repository   | GitBucket, GitLab    |
| Issue management system         | Redmine              |
| CI environment                   | Jenkins, GitLab |
| Communication tool | Slack, Rocket.Chat    |


It is good if an environment is already available, but if not, use

to develop the necessary tools.

See the ["Team development environment" section of the "Sample Project Development Guide"](https://github.com/Fintan-contents/nablarch-system-development-guide/tree/master/en/Sample_Project/Sample_Project_Development_Guide#team-development-environment) for examples of how to set up an environment.
