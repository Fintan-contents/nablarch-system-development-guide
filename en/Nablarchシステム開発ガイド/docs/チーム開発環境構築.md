# Setting Up the Team Development Environment
A variety of tools are required to get started with team development.

| Item                     | Example                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Source code repository   | GitBucket, GitLab    |
| Issue management system         | Redmine              |
| CI environment                   | Jenkins, ConcourseCI |
| Communication tool | Slack, RocketChat    |


It is good if an environment is already available, but if not, use
[Collaborage](https://github.com/Fintan-contents/collaborage/blob/master/README.md)
to develop the necessary tools.

See the "Development Environment" section of the "Sample Application Development Project Guide" for examples of how to set up an environment.
