# Application Configuration (REST)

The REST application configuration in this project is essentially the same as the [application configuration (Web)](./Application_Configuration_(Web).md).

The reason for doing this is given below.

- Application developers create almost the same deliverables
- Since Web and REST may be piggybacked on the same war, there is an advantage in preparing the same configuration
