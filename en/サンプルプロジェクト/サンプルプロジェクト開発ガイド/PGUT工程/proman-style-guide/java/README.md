# Java Style Guide

This section describes the coding conventions, code formatters and static inspection guides to help you code using Java.
Use these resources to prevent bugs and write code of high quality.

Refer to the Java coding conventions to write better code.

- [Java coding conventions](./java-style-guide.md)

The Java coding conventions assumes that what can be checked automatically with a code formatter or static inspection has been implemented in advance.

Format it with the code formatter. 
A code formatter that can be used immediately is provided.

- [Java code formatter](./code-formatter.md)

Resolve any code violations that can be detected automatically with Checkstyle.

- [Checkstyle guide](./staticanalysis/checkstyle/README.md)

Exclude code that can clearly cause problems with SpotBugs or that is likely to cause problems later.

- [SpotBugs guide](./staticanalysis/spotbugs/README.md)

Limit the APIs used by the unauthorized API check tool as needed.
